// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if sum is even
print even
else 
print odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
num1
num2
num3
num4
num5
sum = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5
avg = sum \ 5
smn = smallest number
lgm = largest number

print avg ## prints the sum of all numbers divided by 5 to get the average
print smn, lgm ## prints the smallest number and the largest number of the set of 5
